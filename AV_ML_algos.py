Broadly, there are 3 types of Machine Learning Algorithms:

1. Supervised Learning

How it works: This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or
dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors
(independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function
that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the
model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.

Examples of Supervised Learning: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN,
Logistic Regression, etc.

print "\n"+ '-' * 80

2. Unsupervised Learning

How it works: In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable
to predict / estimate.  It is used for clustering population in different
groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for
specific intervention.

Examples of Unsupervised Learning: Apriori algorithm, K-means.

3. Reinforcement Learning:

How it works:  Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific
decisions. It works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it
trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from past
experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate
business decisions.

Example of Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Process

List of Common Machine Learning Algorithms

Here is the list of commonly used machine learning algorithms. These algorithms
can be applied to almost any data problem:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
SVM
Naive Bayes
KNN
K-Means
